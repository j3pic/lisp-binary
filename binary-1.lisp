There is still a potential problem here. Suppose that getting to the REQUIRED-LENGTH requires adding an odd number

Alternately, suppose that the input is too long, and the TRUNCATE restart is chosen. If the input is one byte longer

a condition is raised every time an (EVAL ...) type is encountered,
with restarts available to tell the macro whether a bitstream is
required for that particular field. 

Typically, the error would reach EMACS, and the programmer can then
pick a restart from the menu.

However, this doesn't work if you're using COMPILE-FILE, because COMPILE-FILE
catches exceptions, so you don't see the error until it has already been
caught, so you will not be presented with the restarts that I have set up.

For most programs, just ignoring the issue is good enough. Setting this to T (the default)
causes the expander to ignore this problem and not raise a condition.")

This is the shittiest implementation ever. It functionally rebuilds the entire

There are several reasons for this. First, the tag system can tolerate a
direct SETF of *QUEUED-POINTERS*, but it cannot tolerate mutation of the
underlying data structure. That is because I'm attempting to rely on the
way special variables work in multithreaded Lisps as a source of thread
safety. Mutating *QUEUED-POINTERS* with RPLACA or RPLACD could be seen
in another thread, but rebuilding the list and SETFing it will not affect
other threads.

FIXME: This approach doesn't provide thread safety unless every
thread binds *QUEUED-POINTERS* with a LET or LAMBDA form. The
WRITE-BINARY method can't do this because it must be able to
push items onto the tag that can be seen by other implementations
of WRITE-BINARY that might have the corresponding DUMP-TAG call."

;; One difficult thing to do is handle offsets within files. Some
;; file formats specify entire tables of offsets in the middle of
;; a structure. It is desireable to be able to resolve these offsets
;; into the objects they point to, and then convert them back into
;; offsets when the object is written back to disk.
;;
;; But the offsets have a base-pointer, which can be some completely
;; arbitrary value, but is often either:
;;
;;  The beginning of the file.
;;
;;  The beginning or end of a structure header.
;;
;;  The beginning or end of the offset itself.
;;
;;  The beginning of some arbitrary field in the structure.
;;
;; In the latter two cases, we can't just go ahead and read the pointer,
;; because the base-pointer isn't known until the entire header or even
;; a large portion of the file has been read.
;;
;; This can be solved by waiting until the entire header is read,
;; and only then converting the offsets into the data they point to.
;; This requires a placeholder to be put in the slot representing
;; the offset. This placeholder serves two functions: First, it
;; contains the actual offset that was read from the file.
;; Second, it remembers the type of object that is to be read.
;;
;; The macroexpander must remember the name of each field that is expected
;; to contain such a placeholder, and insert code to read the pointer and
;; replace the field. 
;;
;; The other problem is more difficult: An offset can be part of
;; a substructure embedded in a larger header, and so will be read
;; in a recursive call to READ-BINARY. The entire header
;; isn't read until the *top* level instance of `read-binary'
;; is done reading data. Therefore, `read-binary' must be given
;; an option to tell it not to resolve pointers, which must
;; be propagated recursively, so that recursive calls to READ-BINARY
;; do not attempt to resolve the offsets they encounter. This could
;; probably be handled with a special variable.
;;
;; Worse yet, an offset found in a structure can have a base
;; pointer relative to a field in a substructure.
;;
;; Even more difficult is writing offsets back to disk. Again,
;; writing of pointers cannot begin until the entire header
;; has been written to disk. That means that every time we
;; encounter a field that must be written as an offset, we
;; must remember the offset *of the offset*, and come back to
;; it when the address is known, which happens after the
;; header has been written. In the meantime, the offset must
;; be written as zero, or another nonce value. This calls for
;; yet another special variable, which stores a map of Lisp objects
;; waiting to be written to disk to the offsets of the offsets
;; that will point to them.
;;
;; Every time a value that is to be written as an offset is encountered,
;; a cons `(,object . ,(file-position)) is pushed onto the table. When
;; the toplevel READ-BINARY is reached, it pops each object, appends
;; it to the file, and writes its base-pointer-corrected offset to the
;; stored file-position.
;;
;; The only question is what to do if the file is divided into sections,
;; each with its own type of data.

A Virtual Type is a rule that tells the LISP-BINARY how to read a particular kind of
value from a stream, and how to write it back. The result of reading a Virtually-Typed object
can be an object of any Lisp type. Which Lisp type the Virtual Type corresponds to must
be specified in the LISP-TYPE argument.

The same LISP-TYPE can be produced by many different Virtual Types. As a result, the LISP-BINARY
library must always be told which type it is reading or writing. This is usually done at compile-time
through the DEFBINARY macro.

The READER and WRITER must be functions.

The READER accepts a STREAM argument and returns two values:

   1. The fully-processed value that was read.
   2. The number of bytes that were read from the STREAM. If the STREAM is a BIT-STREAM,
      then the number of bytes can be fractional, to indicate how much was read down to
      the bit. 1/8 of a byte = 1 bit.

The WRITER accepts the lambda list (OBJ STREAM), where OBJ is the value to be written. It
returns the number of bytes that were written.

object that describes the field. The LAMBDA-LIST will be structurally matched against
the :TYPE parameter specified in the DEFBINARY form. The BODY may begin with the keyword
:WHERE followed by a form. If present, this form acts as a further condition for considering
the LAMBDA-LIST to match the :TYPE parameter.

The BODY is expected to return 3 values:

1. The Lisp type that should be used to represent the instance of this LISP-BINARY type described
   by the LAMBDA-LIST. 
2. A form that reads an instance of the data described by the LAMBDA-LIST from a stream whose name
   will be bound to STREAM-SYMBOL.
3. A form that writes an instance of the data from a variable whose name will be bound to NAME, into
   a stream whose name is bound to STREAM-SYMBOL.

The slots of the DEFBINARY-TYPE object provide extra information, and will be bound in the BODY using
WITH-SLOTS. These slots are described below:

   NAME       - The name of the variable to be defined. The WRITER-FORM will be evaluated in a context
                where the NAME is bound to the object being written.
   TYPE       - The type specifier. It's the same value that will have been matched against the LAMBDA-LIST.

   BYTE-ORDER - :LITTLE-ENDIAN or :BIG-ENDIAN.
   TERMINATOR - A SIMPLE-ARRAY that will be matched against the input to determine the end of a string.
                If the TYPE is itself a SIMPLE-ARRAY, TERMINATOR can be a function, which will be passed
                each element read. (TODO: Actually implement that function part)
   READER     - A user-specified function that overrides the reader that this function would otherwise
                generate.
   WRITER     - A user-specified writer function that overrides the default writer.
   STREAM-SYMBOL - The name that will be given to the input and output stream.

   PREVIOUS-DEFS-SYMBOL - A symbol that will be bound to a list of LET bindings at runtime. In the event of
                          an EVAL type, code is generated that will splice the LET bindings found here
                          into a runtime-constructed LET form that will then be EVAL'd.
   BYTE-COUNT-NAME      - The name of the variable that will be bound to the number of bytes read or written so far.
   ALIGN                - The alignment boundary
   ELEMENT-ALIGN        - The alignment boundary for individual elements in an array.
   BIND-INDEX-TO        - In array reads and writes, may specify a variable to bind the loop index to.
                          Or it can be NIL.
